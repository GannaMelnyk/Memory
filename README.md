Hi everybody!
I'll trying to speak shortly.
It's a simple game about matching cards pairs. The mechanic is simple: only two cards can be visible. When you flip third card, other two flip down. Try to do it with the smallest amount of iterations. Remember, that game level increase and numbers of cards make it too.

The game is a simple project, so the way to launch it, it's just a download to your iPhone or iPad and launch as a app.
I am hopping, you would enjoy it!
